## Introduction
   ####  A cross word puzzle consists of a rectangular grid of black and white squares and two lists of definitions (or description). one list of definitions is for "words" to be written left to right across white squares in the rows and the other list is for words to be written down white squares in the columns. (A word is a sequence of alphabetic character.) To solve a crossword puzzle, one writes the words corresponding to the definition on the white squares of the grid.
     
  ####  The definitions correspond to the rectangular grid by means of sequential integers on "eligible" white squares. White squares with black squares immediately to the left or above them "eligible". white squares with no square either immediately to the left or above are also "eligible". No other squares are numbered. All the squares on the first row are numbered.
     
 ####   The numbering starts with 1 and continues consecutively across white squares of the fisrt row, then across the eligible white squares of the second row, then across the eligible white squares of the third row and so on across all of the rows of puzzle. The picture below illustrates a rectangular crossword puzzle grid with appropriate numbering.
